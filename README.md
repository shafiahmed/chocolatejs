## <a name="Choco-UseIt"></a> Use it [⌂](#Choco-Summary)

Chocolate runs on your server and responds to https requests on port 8026

You can change port number in /etc/init/chocolate.conf where you add the **port** parameter after  `/home/chocolate/myapp` at line:

    exec sudo -u chocolate -i /usr/local/lib/node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee /usr/local/lib/node_modules/chocolate/server/monitor.coffee /home/chocolate/myapp 80 2>&1 >> /var/log/node.log

You can also use a simple Http server by specifying options in the config.coffee file:

    exports.http_only = yes
    exports.port = 80

### <a name="Choco-UseIt-LogOn"></a> Log on [⌂](#Choco-Summary)

You defined a master key when using chocomake to create myapp.

You enter that key at: 

    https://myserver:8026/-/server/interface?register_key

### <a name="Choco-UseIt-LogOff"></a> Log off [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

To logoff go to : 

    https://myserver:8026/-/server/interface?forget_key

### <a name="Choco-UseIt-Enter"></a> Enter Chocolate Studio [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

To enter Chocolate Studio, go to: 

    https://myserver:8026/-/server/studio

There you can create, modify, move and commit source files

### <a name="Choco-UseIt-Source"></a> Web access to source files and functions [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

You access a file directly in the browser:

To display `default.coffee` as raw text

    https://myserver:8026/default?how=raw

To display `default.coffee` as documentation text (docco)

    https://myserver:8026/default?how=help

To edit `default.coffee`

    https://myserver:8026/default?how=edit

To run `default.spec.coffee` specs (if you create it)

    https://myserver:8026/default?so=eval

### <a name="Choco-UseIt-Locco"></a> Locco: the Chocolate protocol [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

Requests to Chocolate server follow theses rules (the Locco protocol):

**https**

By default, Chocolate uses Https:

Http requests are redirected to https  
Https server is located (by default) at port 8026  
Http server is located at port Https+1 (8027)

You can specify options in data/config.coffee file:

    exports.http_only = yes or no
    exports.port = <main port number>
    exports.key = <key filename>
    exports.cert = <cert filename>

**Chocolate system services and files**

They are accessible at:

    https://myserver:8026/-/server...
    https://myserver:8026/-/general...

**Your app services and files**

They are at:

    https://myserver:8026/mydir/myservice...

**Default service in source file**

If your source file exports an `interface` function (ie. in default.coffee):
    
    exports.interface = () -> 
        'Hello world!'    

Then it is called when you request that file with no parameter:

    https://myserver:8026/default
    
returns a web page with

    Hello world!

**Locco protocol operations**

- **`so`** indicates the action type.

    - **`do`**:  execute an exported function in source file  
        - parameters can be specified by name or by position
    - **`move`**: 
        - if **`what`** is specified:  
        move **`what`** file's content to **`where`** file  
        - otherwise, if Http request is a **POST** request then:  
        move POST message data to **`where`** file  
        
    - **`eval`**: run the **where** file associated spec: ie. default.spec.coffee for default.coffee
    - **`go`**: default action. Load **where** file and execute interface function.

- **`what`** adds a precision on the action object (usualy its pathname).
- **`where`** tells where the action should take place: a pathname
- **`how`** asks for a special type of respond if available (web, raw, help).
    - **`web`**: default. responds as an html document
    - **`raw`**: responds as plain text
    - **`help`**: responds as an html Docco help file
    - **`edit`**: responds as an html source web editor

- a **`backdoor_key`** key can be specified to have system access

        https://myserver/!/my_backdoor_key/myworld/myfolder
            
Usage:

        https://myserver/myworld/myfolder?so=move&what=/myworld/mydocument
           Moves /myworld/mydocument file to /myworld/myfolder
           so = move
           what = /myworld/mydocument
           where = /myworld/myfolder
           how = web (by default) - will return an answer as html.

        https://myserver/myworld/myfolder
           Go to /myworld/myfolder file, 
             load it and execute **interface** function if exists,
             otherwise open file in editor
           so = go (by default)
           what = undefined
           where = /myworld/myfolder
           how = web (by default) - will return an answer as html.

        https://myserver/myworld/myfolder?myFunc&myParamValue
           Go to /myworld/myfolder file, 
             load it and execute **myFunc** function if exists, with myParamValue param
             otherwise returns empty page
           so = do (by default when request has parameters)
           what = myFunc
           where = /myworld/myfolder
           how = web (by default) - will return an answer as html.

## <a name="Choco-Studio"></a> Chocolate Studio [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

A sweet web app development environment.

It displays your source files and browse through directories, has a search in files service.  
It has a panel that displays log messages.  
It can also list and open source file commited versions.

You can create and move files (but not rename or delete files ! I should add this...).

The central panel has the code editor.
It has syntax highlighting for Coffeescript, Javascript, CSS and Markdown.

<a name="Choco-Automplete"></a>
### <a name="Choco-Studio"></a> Autocomplete and Snippets [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

It has a basic automplete feature that, by pressing CTRL+SPACE keys, 
proposes you a list of words collected from your file. 

It also has snippets that will expand code from a shortcut:  
in an HTML file, html5+CTRL+SPACE will become: 
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
                <title>`substitute(Filename('', 'Page Title'), '^.', '\u&', '')`</title>
                meta
            </head>
            <body>
                body
            </body>
        </html>

Then you can move to *meta* and *body* section by pressing the TAB key.

Currently there are Coffeescript, Javascript, CSS and HTML snippets in the editor.

<a name="Choco-Studio-panels"></a>
### Spec, Doc, Lab, Help and Notes panels [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

The central panel can also split to display the associated spec file (see [Specolate](#Choco-Specolate))  
or the source file in help mode (see [Doccolate](#Choco-Doccolate))
or the [Lab](#Choco-Lab) that can be used to test Coffeescript or Chocodown code.

The help panel lists some usefull resources. Links will be opened in the central panel.

The [Notes](#Choco-Newnotes) panel allows you to write and save some notes.

**Usage**

## <a name="Choco-Lab"></a> The Lab [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

The Lab helps you write your code and test cases, syntax...

**Coffeescript Lab**

When you type Coffescript code in the Lab editor, it is immediately translated in Javascript.  
You can use this service to learn Coffeescript but also to verify that your code will do what you expect it should.

Beside beeing translated in Javascript it is also immediately executed.  
And you can see the result in the terminal panel.

But more... when you display the **Debug** panel you can see your variables values through code execution!  
This service is inspired by Bret Victor's [lecture](http://vimeo.com/36579366) (Inventing on priciples).

Copy the following code in the Coffeescript Lab with the Debug panel:

        binarySearch = (key, array) ->
            low = 0
            high = array.length-1
        
            while (low <= high)
                mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2)
                value = array[mid]
        
                if value > key
                    high = mid - 1
                else if value < key
                    low = mid + 1
                else
                    return mid
            return -1
        
        result = binarySearch 'f', ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e','f']

Then change the `'f'` to something else and see the Debug panel change in live!

This service is experimental but it has been really useful to me.

**Chocodown Lab**

Literate  programming...

Chocodown panel lets you write Markdown, Chocokup and Coffeescript code that will be 
immediately translated to html and javascript!

But more... when you display the **Dom** panel you can see immmediately the result!

Basicaly, this panel is a Markdown editor, but you can insert code blocks by using
the **#** and the **!** signs followed by the language you want to use:
html, css, javascript, coffeescript, chocokup.

When you use the # sign, Chocodown displays and highlights the following code.  
When you use the ! sign, it executes the code.  
And you can use both **#!**

Copy the following code in the Chocokup Lab with the Dom panel:
    
    ### Here is a basic Chocodown sample:
    
    **Css code**
    
        #! css
        #chocodown-demo .header,
        #chocodown-demo .footer {
            border: 1px solid grey;
            background: maroon;
            color: white;
            text-align: center;
        }
    
    **Chocokup code**
    
        #! chocokup
        panel "#chocodown-demo", ->
            header -> 'header'
            footer -> 'footer'
            body ->
                for i in [0..3] 
                    button "#{i}"
    
    **Coffeescript code**
    
        #! coffeescript
        
        buttons = document.querySelectorAll '#chocodown-demo button'
        for button in buttons
            addEvent = button.addEventListener ? button.attachEvent
            addEvent.call button, "click", -> 
                alert "I'm button #" + @innerhtml


And see...

Then change **[0.\.3]** to **[0.\.6]** and see the result...

## <a name="Choco-WriteModules"></a> How to write Modules [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

You can create a module by pressing the `Create` button. 
It will create a module with the name you provide in the currently displayed folder.
If you dont put a suffix the the filename, it will create a Coffescript file with .coffee suffix.

Supported file types are: .coffee, .js, .html, .css, .md

If you have asset files you want to be downloadable from the web (like images or js libraries), 
put them in the `/static` folder.

It is supposed that you will put modules that run only in the **node.js** environment in the `/server` folder.
Modules that run only in the browser will go int the `/client` folder, 
and modules that can run in both environment will be put in `/general` folder.

If you put .coffee or .js files in the `/client` or `/general` folder, 
they will be compiled if .coffee and copied to the `/static/ijax` folder 
and will be downloadable by your javascript client code (using the provided require function).

If you create a general module (that can work on server and in browser), you will need to write something like the following code:

    class MyGeneralModule
        constructor: ->
            ...
        
    _module = window ? module
    _module.exports = MyGeneralModule

The exported function `interface`, if present in your module, is used to return an html content if someone calls that module with no parameter:

i.e., in module `mymodule.coffee`:

    exports.interface = ->
        '<div>Hello</div>'

Will display `Hello` when called with `https://myserver/mymodule`

You can write module that runs on server with functions that you can call directly from the browser like this:

    exports.say_hello = (who = 'you', where = 'Paris') ->
        'hello ' + who + ' in ' + where

This function can be called like this:

`https://myserver/mymodule?say_hello` and display `hello you in Paris`  
`https://myserver/mymodule?say_hello&me` and display `hello me in Paris`  
`https://myserver/mymodule?say_hello&me&London` and display `hello me in London`  
`https://myserver/mymodule?say_hello&where=Madrid` and display `hello you in Madrid`  
`https://myserver/mymodule?say_hello&who=me&where=Madrid` and display `hello me in Madrid`  

Those function can declare a system parameter `__` which contains:

      .appdir: application directory
      .datadir: application data directory
      .request: HTTP request object
      .response: HTTP response object

i.e.:

    exports.check_appdir = (__) ->
        "Application directory is:" + __.appdir

&nbsp;

## <a name="Choco-DB"></a> ChocoDB [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

ChocoDB is intended to be *a kind of* nosql database running on SQLite.

Currently, you can use it to store javascript objects in database and retrive them by id.
Functions, Dates and circular references can also be saved and retrieved.

A query language is on its way...

Here is example taken from the /server/reserve spec file:

        
        var Uuid = require 'chocolate/general/intentware/uuid'
        var Sample;
        
        Sample = (function() {
          function _Class(title, uuid) {
            this.title = title;
            this.uuid = uuid != null ? uuid : Uuid();
            this.list = [10, 11, 12, 13];
            this.list.extended = 'an extension';

## <a name="Choco-Flow"></a> Chocoflow [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

Chocoflow is a really simple tool to help manage asynchronous calls serialization.

You can change this javascript code:

        db.createOrGetTable(function(table) {
          return table.insertRow(row, function() {
            return db.select(query(function(rows) {
              return console.log(rows.count);
            }));
          });
        });

to this code:

        Flow.serialize(function(defer, local) {
          defer(function(next) {
            return db.createOrGetTable(function(table) {
              local.table = table;
              return next();
            });
          });
          defer(function(next) {
            return local.table.insertRow(row, function() {
              return next();
            });
          });
          defer(function(next) {
            return db.select(query(function(rows) {
              local.rows = rows;
              return next();
            }));
          });
          return defer(function() {
            return console.log(local.rows.count);
          });
        });

or in Coffeescript, this code:

        db.createOrGetTable (table) ->
            table.insertRow row,  ->
                db.select query (rows) ->
                    console.log rows.count
                    
to this code:

        Flow.serialize (defer, local) ->
            defer (next) -> db.createOrGetTable (table) -> local.table = table; next()
            defer (next) -> local.table.insertRow row,  -> next()
            defer (next) -> db.select query (rows) -> local.rows = rows; next()
            defer -> console.log local.rows.count



It helps you mix synchronous and asynchronous, iterative and recursive code, 
in a **simple** way with **no new concept** to learn.
    
Here is an example taken from /general/chocoflow spec file:

        var Flow, end, start, time1, time2, time3, aync_func;

        aync_func = function(duration, cb) {
          return setTimeout((function() {
            return cb(new Date().getTime());
          }), duration);
        };

        Flow = require('chocolate/general/chocoflow');
        
        start = new Date().getTime();
        time1 = time2 = time3 = end = null;
        
        Flow.serialize(function(defer) {
        
          defer(function(next) {
            return aync_func(250, function(time) {
              time1 = time;
              return next();
            });
          });
        
          defer(function(next) {
            return aync_func(150, function(time) {
              time2 = time;
              return next();
            });
          });
        
          defer(function(next) {
            return aync_func(350, function(time) {
              time3 = time;
              return next();
            });
          });
        
          defer(function() {
            // expect(time1 - start).toBeGreaterThan(250 - 5);
            // expect(time2 - start).toBeGreaterThan(400 - 5);
            // expect(time3 - start).toBeGreaterThan(750 - 5);
            // expect(end - start).toBeLessThan(10);
          });
          
          end = new Date().getTime();
        });

## <a name="Choco-Debugate"></a> Debugate [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

Debugate is really basic tool to help profile and log code execution.

Here is a sample taken from the /general/debugate spec file:

        var Debug = require('chocolate/general/debugate'), f1;
        
        f1 = function(cb) {
          return setTimeout((function() {
            return cb(new Date().getTime());
          }), 250);
        };
        
        Debugate.profile.start('Test time spent');
        
        f1(function(time) {
          Debugate.profile.end('Test time spent');
          
          // expect(Debugate.profile.spent('Test time spent').time).toBeGreaterThan((250 - 5) * 1000);
          // expect(Debugate.profile.spent('Test time spent').time).toBeLessThan((250 + 5) * 1000);
        });

## <a name="Choco-Chocokup"></a> Chocokup [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

Chocokup is derived from [Coffeekup](http://coffeekup.org) which is a templating engine for node.js and browsers that lets you to write your html templates in 100% pure CoffeeScript.

What Chocokup adds is the "Panel orientation" missing from html which is page oriented.

Chocokup introduces few new tags:

 - panel
 - box

and modifies some already existing tags:

 - body
 - header
 - footer

Using a pure Coffeescript syntax, you can write this:

    panel proportion:"served", ->
        panel "aside left"
        panel "main"
        panel "aside right"

which translates into:

    <div class="space">
      <div class="space service horizontal left">
        <div class="space">aside left</div>
      </div>
      <div class="space service horizontal served center">
        <div class="space">main</div>
      </div>
      <div class="space service horizontal right">
        <div class="space">aside right</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
and displays as a main panel with a left and a right service panels.

You can also write Css code using Chocokup:

    panel "#calc", ->
        button i for i in [9..0]
        button '+' ; button '-'
        button '.by3', '='           
            
    css ->
        width = 160
        nbColumn = 3
        
        box: ->
            border: '1px solid black'
            width: width + 'px'
            minHeight: '20px'
            textAlign: 'center'
            whiteSpaceCollapse: 'collapse'
            
        '#calc':
            box:on
            
        button:
            width: width / nbColumn - 4
            height: width / nbColumn - 4
            
        'button.by3':
            width: width 

This will display a basic Calculator

### <a name="Choco-Chocokup-Usage"></a> Usage [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

#### <a name="Choco-Chocokup-Document"></a> Chocokup.Document [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

In a Coffeescript source file (ie. : mypage.coffee),  
insert an `interface` function that returns a new `Chocokup.Document`
        
    Chocokup = require 'chocolate/general/chocokup'
    
    exports.interface = ->
        new Chocokup.Document 'Chocolate - Wep Apps with a sweet taste', ->
            body ->
                "Welcome to Chocolatejs.org !"

            
Then open a web browser and open that page: ie. https://myserver/mypage

#### <a name="Choco-Chocokup-Panel"></a> Chocokup.Panel [⌂](#Choco-Summary) 

If you only want to build a partial document, you can use `Chocokup.Panel`

    Chocokup = require 'chocolate/general/chocokup'
    
    kup = ->
        text "Welcome to Chocolatejs.org !"
        
    exports.interface = ->
        new Chocokup.Panel(kup).render()

    unless window?
        describe ...

### Browser only module

    if window?
        describe ...

### General module

    Newnotes = require './newnotes'

        it 'creates, then lists a basic todo', ->
            newnotes = new Newnotes
            newnotes.add 'do first'
            newnotes.add 'do after'
            expect([todo.title for todo in newnotes.list()].join(',')).toEqual 'do first,do after'
